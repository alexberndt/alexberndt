## Bio

I am a machine learning engineer at Overstory.ai where I work on solving a wide variety of data-related problems. My main focus is on designing, implementing and orchestrating machine learning pipelines. This not only involves ensuring we use the best ML models, theoretically, but ensuring these pipelines are scalable and efficient in production.

## Projects

- **ISS Tracker** @ [iss-tracker.live](https://iss-tracker.live)

    Webapp which shows the current location of the International Space Station and some other statistics.

- **The Data-Driven Developer** @ [blog.alexberndt.com](https://blog.alexberndt.com)

    Simple blog about topics related, but not limited to, machine learning, AI and algorithms in general.

## Interests

I am a generally curious person and interested in a wide variety of topics. In my current role as a machine learning engineer, I am particularly interested in

- Productization of ML-based pipelines,
- Designing and optimizing data-driven processes,
- Interfacing business value and algorithm optimization functions.

Other non-work related interests include

- Full-stack web development,
- A casual chess game,
- Playing the piano.
